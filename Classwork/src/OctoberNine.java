  now notice we had to cast the item to the type comparable (because our compareTo method is only applicable to the comparable interface) 
  keep in mind the item class should already implement the comparable type but we used it as Object type.
  ***** we also have the current!=null before the other condition because the other one first could give us an error, because you may hit null
